This program aims to simplify E-book creation from DIY Book Scanners (http://diybookscanner.org/)

It was created in combination with the Paper Upgrade Project (www.paperupgrade.org), a 501(c)(3) educational public charity. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS 
===========================
This project was coded in python using Django and is intentionally cross-platform:

1. Install Python 2.7 (do not install or use 3 or higher)*
2. Install Django (http://www.djangoproject.com/download/) (e.g. copying it to c:\python27\Lib\site-packages)
3. Install the DIY Ebook Creator package (e.g. copying it to c:\python27\Lib\site-packages)
* NOTE: python, though not necessarily 2.7, is usually pre-installed on Mac OsX and Linux

A Windows Installer (.exe) version, which automates these installation steps, is also available via
